# Measuring Categorical Perception in Color-Coded Scatterplots
This is the code release for paper *Measuring Categorical Perception in Color-Coded Scatterplots*. This project includes experiment study website and scatterplot tasks dataset.

## Dataset Usage
This dataset includes the x, y data of scatterplots for the experiment studies. There are ten batches in dataset folder, each batch contains 45 scatterplots data. Each csv file represent one scatterplot, with x, y data within range [0, 10], and category information range from 0 to 9.

## Website Usage
Please use [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) to start the website in public folder.
You can also visit https://categorical-scatterplot-study.web.app/ for our experiment study website.

## User Response
Yon can find the metadata of user response in dataset folder. Each row represent each task, including the information of category number, difficulty level (delta), and number of points. Each participant will only see one color palette. The time spent recorded in milliseconds.
